# LinkedIn-Post-Generator

###  Overview
This project is a LinkedIn post generator powered by LLMs (Large Language Models). It allows users to generate LinkedIn posts based on a selected topic, length, and language using a few-shot learning approach. The application is built using Python and Streamlit for an interactive user interface.

### Features

1. Extracts metadata from raw LinkedIn posts (line count, language, and tags).

2. Unifies similar tags for consistency.

3. Uses past posts as examples for better post generation.

4. Generates posts based on user-selected criteria (topic, length, and language).

5. Supports an interactive Streamlit interface for ease of use.
